# Overview

# System Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

We recommend a computer with 32G DRAM, AMD Ryzen 7 6800H with Radeon Graphics 3.20 GHz CPU, and a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti GPU to run most data analysis source codes. But for the atomic tracing, we recommend a computer with 64G DRAM.

## Software Requirements

### OS Requirements

This package has been tested on the following Operating System:

Linux: CentOS 6 2.6.32
Windows: Windows 11 Version 24H2 
Mac OSX: We have not tested it on a Mac yet, but it should in principle work.   

### Matlab Version Requirements

This package has been tested with `Matlab` R2022b. All the codes have to run in their own folders. We recommend the use of `Matlab` version R2021a or higher to test the data and source codes.
