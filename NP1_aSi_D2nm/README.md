#### 1.1 projections

Folder: [Projections](./NP1_aSi_D2nm/1.1_projections)

This folder contains the projections after alignment as well as their corresponding angles.

#### 1.2 Reconstruction

Folder: [Reconstructions](./NP1_aSi_D2nm/1.2_reconstructions)

Run the tomography reconstruction code to obtain the 3D reconstruction of the nanoparticles.

#### 1.3 Atom Tracing

Folder: [Tracing Atom Position](./NP1_aSi_D2nm/1.3_tracing)

Run the polynomial atom tracing code to obtain the 3D coordinates of atoms in the nanoparticles.

#### 1.4 Atom Classification and RMSD Calculation 

Folder: [Classification and RMSD](./NP1_aSi_D2nm/1.4_classification_CalRMSD)

Run the k-mean classification code to distinguish atom from non-atom. Run the RMSD calculation code to obtain the accuracy of the traced atom.
