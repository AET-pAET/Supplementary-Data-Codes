This folder contains the misaligned CoPdPt raw projections and the corresponding SIRT reconstruction from Busch.
We performed atom tracing and classification using this SIRT reconstruction and calculated the RMSD.
The raw projections were denoised using BM3D, aligned using the Center of Mass method, and reconstructed using RESIRE.
We then traced and classified the atoms again and calculated the RMSD.
Please run the code and examine the uploaded data for detailed information.
