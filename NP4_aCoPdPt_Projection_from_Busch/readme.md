This folder contains the misaligned CoPdPt raw projections and the corresponding SIRT reconstruction from Busch.
We performed atom tracing and classification using this SIRT reconstruction and calculated the RMSD.

We denoised the raw projections using BM3D, aligned them using the Center of Mass and back-projection methods, and performed reconstruction using RESIRE.
We then traced and classified the atoms and calculated the RMSD.
Please run the code and examine the uploaded data for detailed information.
